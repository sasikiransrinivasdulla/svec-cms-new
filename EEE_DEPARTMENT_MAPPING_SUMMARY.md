# EEE Department Module Mapping Implementation

## 🎯 **Implementation Complete**

Successfully configured the EEE (Electrical & Electronics Engineering) department admin dashboard with comprehensive modules mapped to corresponding MySQL tables.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Updated EEE Dashboard Modules**
**File**: `/src/app/departments/[dept]/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Before (21 modules incorrectly mapped to CSE-AI tables):**
- All modules were mapped to `cai_*` tables (CSE-AI department)
- Incorrect mapping causing data confusion

**After (14 comprehensive EEE-specific modules):**

### **Academic Management:**
- **Faculty** → `faculty_profiles` (Department faculty members)
- **Syllabus** → `EEE_Syllabus` (Course curriculum and syllabus)
- **Laboratories** → `labs` (Laboratory facilities and equipment)

### **Research & Innovation:**
- **Faculty Innovations** → `faculty_innovations` (Teaching and research innovations)
- **Research Centers** → `research_centers` (Department research centers)
- **Product Development** → `product_development` (Innovation projects)

### **Academic Activities:**
- **Student Achievements** → `student_achievements` (Student awards)
- **Faculty Achievements** → `faculty_achievements` (Faculty recognitions)
- **Workshops** → `workshops` (Educational workshops)
- **Faculty Development Programs** → `fdp` (Professional development)
- **Organized Events** → `organized_events` (Department events)

### **Publications & Initiatives:**
- **Technical Magazines** → `technical_magazines` (Department publications)
- **Green Initiatives** → `green_initiatives` (Environmental projects)
- **Departmental Activities** → `departmental_activities` (General activities)

### **2. Updated API Route Mappings**
**File**: `/src/app/api/admin/departments/[dept]/[module]/route.ts`

Expanded from 1 module to 14 comprehensive modules with proper table mappings.

### **3. Updated Structure API Mappings**
**File**: `/src/app/api/admin/departments/[dept]/[module]/structure/route.ts`

Updated to handle all 14 EEE modules with correct database table mappings.
