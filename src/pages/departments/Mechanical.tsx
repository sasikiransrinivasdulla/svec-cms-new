                    <span>Hackathons foster collaboration and teamwork among students. Participants usually form teams, bringing together individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise. Working together, they learn to communicate effectively, leverage each other's strengths, and tackle complex problems collectively.

                    <span>The time constraint of a 24-hour hackathon encourages participants to think innovatively and creatively. Students are often required to come up with novel solutions to problems or create something entirely new within a limited timeframe. This pressure fuels innovation and pushes participants to explore unconventional ideas, leading to the development of unique projects.</span>

                    <span>Hackathons offer a platform for students to enhance their existing skills and acquire new ones. During the event, participants may have to learn and use new technologies, programming languages, or tools to complete their projects. This process helps broaden their skillset, exposes them to different technologies, and allows them to experiment with cutting-edge tools and platforms.</span>
                  </li>

It demonstrates their passion for learning, problem-solving ability, teamwork skills, and ability to work under pressure. Employers and educational institutions often consider hackathon experience as a strong indicator of a student's practical skills and motivation.</span>
