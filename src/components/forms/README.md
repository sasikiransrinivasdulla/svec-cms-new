```tsx
import { DepartmentInfoForm } from '@/components/forms/DepartmentInfoForm';

function MyComponent() {
  const handleSuccess = () => {
    console.log('Data saved successfully');
    // Refresh data or redirect
  };

    console.log('Form cancelled');
    // Close modal or redirect
  };

  return (
    <DepartmentInfoForm
      dept="cse" // Optional: pre-fill department
      initialData={existingData} // Optional: for editing
      onSuccess={handleSuccess}
      onCancel={handleCancel}
    />
  );
}
```

### 2. Using the Complete Dashboard

```tsx
import DataManagementDashboard from '@/app/dashboard/data-management/page';

// This provides a complete interface for all forms
function AdminPanel() {
  return <DataManagementDashboard />;
}
```

## 🗃️ Database Integration

### Tables Supported
All forms map to the following database tables from `schema.sql`:

- `department_info` - Department information and HOD details
- `laboratories` - Lab facilities and equipment
- `faculty_profiles` - Faculty personal and professional details
- `faculty_achievements` - Faculty awards and recognitions
- `student_achievements` - Student accomplishments and awards
- `placements` - Student placement records
- `workshops` - Workshop and training programs
- `department_library` - Library resources and books
- `handbooks` - Department handbooks and guides
- `gallery_items` - Photo gallery and events

### Status Management
All records support approval workflow:
- **pending** - Newly created, waiting for approval
- **approved** - Reviewed and approved by admin
- **rejected** - Reviewed but not approved

### Soft Delete
Records are soft-deleted (marked with `deleted_at` timestamp) rather than permanently removed.

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

Each form corresponds to REST API endpoints:

```
GET    /api/department-info          # List all departments
POST   /api/department-info          # Create new department
GET    /api/department-info/[dept]   # Get specific department
PUT    /api/department-info/[dept]   # Update department
DELETE /api/department-info/[dept]   # Delete department

GET    /api/laboratories             # List all labs
POST   /api/laboratories             # Create new lab
PUT    /api/laboratories/[id]        # Update lab
DELETE /api/laboratories/[id]        # Delete lab

# Similar patterns for all other resources...
```

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Creating a New Department

```tsx
const newDeptData = {
  dept: 'ai',
  dept_full_name: 'Artificial Intelligence',
  hod_name: 'Dr. Jane Smith',
  vision: 'To be a leading center for AI education...',
  mission: 'Provide quality education in AI...',
  contact_email: 'ai@college.edu'
};

<DepartmentInfoForm
  initialData={newDeptData}
  onSuccess={() => router.push('/departments')}
  onCancel={() => router.back()}
/>
```

### Editing an Existing Lab

```tsx
const existingLab = {
  id: 1,
  dept: 'cse',
  lab_name: 'Programming Lab',
  capacity: 60,
  softwares: 'Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA',
  // ... other fields
};

<LaboratoryForm
  initialData={existingLab}
  onSuccess={handleUpdateSuccess}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
/>
```

### Filtering and Pagination

```tsx
import { getDepartmentInfo } from '@/utils/database-utils';

// Get approved departments with pagination
const departments = await getDepartmentInfo(
  { status: 'approved' },
  { page: 1, limit: 10, sortBy: 'dept_full_name' }
);

// Get labs for specific department
const cselabs = await getLaboratories(
  { dept: 'cse', status: 'approved' },
  { page: 1, limit: 20 }
);
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types can be uploaded
- **Size Limitations**: File size restrictions prevent abuse
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries used throughout
- **CSRF Protection**: Forms include CSRF tokens where needed

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Form Handling
1. Always provide `onSuccess` and `onCancel` callbacks
2. Use `initialData` for editing existing records
3. Handle loading states in parent components
4. Show appropriate error messages

### File Uploads
1. Validate file types on both client and server
2. Provide image previews where applicable
3. Handle upload progress for large files
4. Clean up old files when updating

### Data Management
1. Use soft deletes for data integrity
2. Implement approval workflows for sensitive data
3. Maintain audit trails with timestamps
4. Regular backups of file uploads

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Forms not submitting:**
- Check network connectivity
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**File uploads failing:**
- Verify file size is within limits
- Check file type is supported
- Ensure upload directory has write permissions

**Validation errors:**
- Review Zod schema requirements
- Check required fields are filled
- Verify date formats are correct

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` to enable detailed error logging and validation messages.
