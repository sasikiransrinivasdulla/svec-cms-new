## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error
- Verify user was created: Check if setup script ran successfully
- Verify password: Should be `placement@2025`
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='placement';`

### Dashboard not loading
- Check localStorage: Should have `auth_token` and `auth_user`
- Check role: User role must be `'placement'`
- Open DevTools → Network tab to see API calls

### "Role not recognized"
- Verify users table has role set to `'placement'`
- Clear browser cache and re-login
