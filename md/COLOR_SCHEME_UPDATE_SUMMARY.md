# Color Scheme Update Summary

## Changes Made

We have successfully updated the website to use a consistent color scheme across all pages:

1. **Color Standardization**
   - Updated all department pages to use the standard red color (#B22222) consistently
   - Removed various inconsistent red shades (#850209, #7f1d1d, #8B0000, etc.)
   - Ensured all text accents, links and headings use the standard color

2. **Updated Components**
   - Modified DepartmentSidebar to use white backgrounds with red accents
   - Updated all pages with consistent color usage

3. **Documentation**
   - Created a comprehensive color scheme documentation file (COLOR_SCHEME_DOCUMENTATION.md)
   - Updated the README.md to reference the color scheme documentation
   - Added guidance for maintaining color consistency

4. **Utility Scripts**
   - Created scripts for color standardization across department files
   - Created a script to scan for non-standard color codes
   - Created a script to fix remaining color inconsistencies

## Results

- **All department pages** now use the consistent color scheme
- **Text and UI elements** are now more readable with white backgrounds and red accents
- **Standardized color usage** makes the website look more professional and cohesive
- **Documentation and tools** ensure future development maintains this consistency

## Next Steps

For any future UI development, refer to the Color Scheme Documentation to maintain consistency. The utility scripts can be used to check for any deviations from the standard color scheme.
