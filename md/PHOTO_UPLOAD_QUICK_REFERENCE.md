- [ ] Select valid image (< 250KB)
- [ ] See file name appear below input
- [ ] See preview thumbnail appear
- [ ] Submit form
- [ ] Verify success toast message
- [ ] Check photo displays in profile display section
- [ ] Test with file > 250KB (should error)
- [ ] Test with non-image file (should error)
- [ ] Edit profile with existing photo
- [ ] Delete profile clears photo state

## Error Messages

- "Photo size must not exceed 250KB" - File too large
- "Only image files are allowed" - Wrong file type
- "Failed to upload photo" - Server error
- "Failed to save profile" - Database error

## Notes for Developers

1. Photos are stored in `public` folder, not database
2. Database stores only the public URL path
3. URLs are always accessible for display
4. Files use unique names to prevent conflicts
5. Older photos are not automatically deleted if replaced
6. Consider cleanup strategy for old images in production

## Deployment Considerations

✅ **Ready:**
- File upload logic
- Directory creation
- Public folder access
- API endpoint

⚠️ **Consider:**
- Backup strategy for uploaded files
- Disk space monitoring
- Cleanup policy for old files
- CDN for image serving (optional)
- S3/Cloud storage (optional, for scaling)
