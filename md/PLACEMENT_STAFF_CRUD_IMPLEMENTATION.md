# Placement Staff CRUD Operations Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing placement staff members in the Placement Dashboard. The system includes a table-based interface with search functionality, inline editing, and proper validation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Create (Add) Staff**
- Form with fields: Faculty Name, Designation, Branch, Email ID
- Real-time validation using Zod schema
- Email uniqueness validation
- Department/branch selection dropdown
- Success/error feedback with toast notifications

### 2. **Read (View) Staff**
- Table-based display with S.No (auto-increment display)
- Search functionality across all fields
- Real-time filtering
- Responsive design with loading states
- Staff count display

### 3. **Update (Edit) Staff**
- Inline edit functionality through action menu
- Pre-populated form with existing data
- Same validation as create operation
- Email uniqueness check (excluding current record)

### 4. **Delete Staff**
- Soft delete implementation (sets deleted_at timestamp)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Proper cleanup with database integrity

## Database Schema

The system uses the existing `placement_staff` table with the following relevant fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE placement_staff (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  designation VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  branch VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
  INDEX idx_email (email),
  INDEX idx_branch (branch),
  INDEX idx_deleted (deleted_at)
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Base Staff Operations
- `GET /api/placement/staff` - Fetch all active staff members
- `POST /api/placement/staff` - Create new staff member

### Individual Staff Operations
- `GET /api/placement/staff/[id]` - Get single staff member
- `PUT /api/placement/staff/[id]` - Update staff member
- `DELETE /api/placement/staff/[id]` - Delete staff member (soft delete)

### API Request/Response Examples

```json
{
  "name": "Dr. John Doe",
  "designation": "Associate Professor",

    "designation": "Associate Professor", 
    "branch": "CSE",
    "email": "john.doe@srivasaviengg.ac.in"
  }
]
```

#### Success Response
