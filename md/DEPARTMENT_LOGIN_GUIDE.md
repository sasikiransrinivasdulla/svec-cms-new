# 🏛️ Department Login System - How It Works

## **Overview**
Your SVEC-CMS now has a complete hierarchical login system with three levels:

### **1. Super Admin Level** 🔑
- **URL**: `http://localhost:9002/super-admin/login`
- **Purpose**: Manage the entire system, create department credentials
- **Your Login**: 
  - Username: `srivasaviengg`
  - Password: `V*@*s*a*v*i*@*2*0*0*1*`

### **2. Department Level** 🏢
- **URL**: `http://localhost:9002/auth/login`
- **Purpose**: Department-specific data management
- **Created by**: Super Admin through credential management

### **3. Admin Level** ⚙️
- **URL**: `http://localhost:9002/auth/login`
- **Purpose**: System-wide administration (existing admin users)

---

## **How Department Users Should Work:**

### **Step 1: Super Admin Creates Department Credentials**
1. Login as Super Admin
2. Go to **Credential Management**
3. Create users for specific departments (CSE, ECE, EEE, etc.)
4. Set their access levels (read/write/admin)
5. Define module permissions

### **Step 2: Department Users Login**
1. Department staff go to: `http://localhost:9002/auth/login`
2. Use credentials provided by Super Admin
3. System automatically redirects them to: `/departments/[their-dept]/dashboard`

### **Step 3: Department Dashboard Access**
Department users get access to:
- **Faculty Management**: Add/edit faculty profiles
- **Student Records**: Manage student data
- **Events & Activities**: Departmental events
- **Achievements**: Student and faculty achievements
- **Placement Records**: Department placement data
- **Reports & Analytics**: Department-specific reports

## **Example Workflow:**

### **Creating a CSE Department User (as Super Admin):**
1. Login to Super Admin
2. Navigate to "Credential Management"
3. Click "Create New User"

   Password: [secure password]
   Access Level: admin
   Modules: faculty, students, events, achievements
   ```
5. Save user

### **CSE User Login Experience:**
1. CSE staff goes to: `http://localhost:9002/auth/login`
2. Enters: username: `cse_admin`, password: [provided password]
3. System redirects to: `http://localhost:9002/departments/cse/dashboard`
4. Sees CSE-specific dashboard with:
   - CSE faculty count
   - CSE student statistics
   - Upcoming CSE events
   - CSE department activities
   - Quick actions for CSE data management
