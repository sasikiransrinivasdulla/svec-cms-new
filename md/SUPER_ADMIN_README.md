   # Create super admin user (replace with your details)
   node -e "
   const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
   bcrypt.hash('your-password', 12).then(hash => {
     console.log('INSERT INTO users (username, email, password_hash, department, department_name, role, is_active) VALUES (\\'admin\\', \\'admin@svec.ac.in\\', \\'', hash, '\\', \\'admin\\', \\'System Administration\\', \\'super_admin\\', 1);');

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   ```bash
   # Check MySQL/MariaDB is running
   sudo systemctl status mysql
   
   # Verify database credentials
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. **JWT Token Issues**
   ```bash
   # Ensure JWT_SECRET is set in .env.local
   echo "JWT_SECRET=$(node -e 'console.log(require("crypto").randomBytes(32).toString("hex"))')" >> .env.local
   ```

3. **Build Errors**
   ```bash
   # Clear cache and reinstall
   rm -rf .next node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Permission Denied**
   ```bash
   # Check file permissions
   chmod +x setup-super-admin.sh
   
   # Check database permissions
   # Ensure user has CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE privileges
   ```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed login attempts
- Permission changes
- User account modifications
- System setting changes
- Department data modifications

### Log Analysis
```sql
-- Check recent super admin activities
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE severity IN ('high', 'critical') 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 50;

-- Monitor failed login attempts
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'login_failed' 
AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```
